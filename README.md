## ENAE311H Final Project - Hypersonic Waverider - “Double-Cone Waverider”

Authors: Fouad Ayoub, Eli Mirny, Riley Edgar

In this project, our group was assigned to design a hypersonic waverider that would perform a freefall/glide from an altitude of 40 km beginning at Mach 10. This waverider must be designed to optimize distance traveled over the course of the glide while remaining under the volume, length, and density constraints given. We assumed inviscid and ideal air, as well as used a standard atmosphere model for our calculations. 

We decided to model the shock wave that would be produced in the hypersonic flow as a conical shock wave being generated by a cone. This conical shock wave model allows for more flexibility in the waverider design, as the conical shock wave requires us to define a quasi-3D flow field, from which we can trace out the surfaces of the waverider. Additionally, using a conical shock wave would allow us to get experience numerically solving pressure and velocity distributions in a 3D flow field, which is described in a later section as well as in section 13.6 of Anderson.

The numerical solutions of a conical shock wave is found in in waverider.m. Further analysis is done in waverider2.m
